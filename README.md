# Gran Turismo 2 plus

The component parts that make up the Gran Turismo 2 plus mod for Gran Turismo 2 by pez2k.

Many of these parts work as standalone mods, however no instruction is provided and intimate knowledge of the tools in the gt2tools repo is assumed. Several experimental or non-GT2+ mods are also included, but not all are fully functional, and may be outdated.

Several of these mods include contributions from other members of the community such as Submaniac93, B_Rad88, and Sirius-R. Please see the credits.txt file in each mod (where present) for any additional contributors.

These files are for research and personal use only. No instruction is provided on how to build GT2+ in its entirety, as it is a lengthy and complex process. Please do not distribute mildly tweaked versions of GT2+, however more comprehensive derivative works are welcomed (for example a larger mod which uses some or all of the GT2+ fixes as a base). If using any part of these files in a derivative work, please contact all credited contributors for those files for their permission.
