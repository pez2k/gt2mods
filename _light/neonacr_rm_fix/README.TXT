Hello GT2 enthusiats. I'm B_Rad88 from the GTP forums and I make GT2 mods. This CAR MOD is to fix an error in the game where the 4door Neon turns into a two-door when appling the race mod. So I modified the dcnar.cdp & dcnar.cnp Neon ACR race texture files with portions of the normal 4door texture into the race texture. Which was a task in its self, but it was needed in order to fix the texture. So please enjoy this Neon ACR race texture fix.


Thank You,
Brandon aka "B_Rad88"
